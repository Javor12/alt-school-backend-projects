   <h3>Biography</h3>
   <p>I am an aspiring software engineer from Ethiopia. I have always felt that I was born to do something great - something that benefits my community. However, I wasn't sure what that "great thing" was.</p>
   <p> One day I realized that I could bring a solution to real life problems we face like barriers to education(the one  AltSchool Africa is addressing),challenges in businesses and modern agriculture inefficiencies - through software engineering.</p>
   <p> Driven by this realization, I began to teach myself how to code. While learning independently, I came across a Binance scholarship that aligned perfectly with my interests. As a Binance user, I applied for the scholarship and was fortunate to be accepted into AltSchool Africa. That is how my journey as an AltSchooler began.</p>
